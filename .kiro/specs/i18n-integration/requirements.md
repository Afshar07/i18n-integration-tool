# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a comprehensive internationalization (i18n) system for the Nuxt.js application to support multiple languages. The system will automatically detect and extract Persian/Arabic text strings, create corresponding English translations, wrap them in i18n functions, and manage translation files with duplicate detection.

## Glossary

- **I18n_System**: The internationalization module and utilities that handle multi-language support
- **Translation_Scanner**: The automated tool that scans source code for Persian/Arabic text strings
- **Translation_Key**: A unique identifier used to reference translated text (e.g., "welcome_message")
- **Translation_File**: JSON files containing key-value pairs for different languages
- **Text_Wrapper**: The process of replacing hardcoded text with i18n function calls
- **Duplicate_Detector**: The system component that identifies and prevents duplicate translation entries
- **Source_Files**: Vue components, JavaScript/TypeScript files, and templates containing text to be translated

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to automatically scan the codebase for Persian/Arabic text strings, so that I can identify all content that needs translation without manual searching.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Translation_Scanner is executed, THE I18n_System SHALL identify all Persian/Arabic text strings in Vue components, JavaScript files, and TypeScript files
2. THE Translation_Scanner SHALL extract text from template sections, script sections, and string literals
3. THE Translation_Scanner SHALL ignore text within comments and documentation
4. THE Translation_Scanner SHALL generate a report of all found Persian/Arabic strings with their file locations
5. THE Translation_Scanner SHALL support Unicode detection for Persian and Arabic character sets

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to generate English translation keys for Persian/Arabic text, so that I can maintain consistent naming conventions across the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Persian/Arabic text is processed, THE I18n_System SHALL generate meaningful English keys based on text content
2. THE I18n_System SHALL create keys using snake_case format for consistency
3. THE I18n_System SHALL ensure generated keys are unique within the translation namespace
4. THE I18n_System SHALL truncate overly long keys while maintaining readability
5. WHERE text content is ambiguous, THE I18n_System SHALL append contextual suffixes to ensure uniqueness

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to automatically wrap identified text strings with i18n functions, so that the application can display translated content dynamically.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN text replacement occurs, THE Text_Wrapper SHALL replace hardcoded strings with $t() function calls
2. THE Text_Wrapper SHALL use the useI18n composable with alias const {t: $t} = useI18n()
3. THE Text_Wrapper SHALL preserve the original text structure and formatting
4. THE Text_Wrapper SHALL handle both template interpolation and script usage
5. THE Text_Wrapper SHALL maintain proper Vue.js syntax and reactivity

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to manage translation files with duplicate detection, so that I can maintain clean and efficient translation resources.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN new translations are added, THE Duplicate_Detector SHALL check for existing identical values
2. IF duplicate values are found, THEN THE I18n_System SHALL prompt for consolidation or unique key creation
3. THE I18n_System SHALL maintain separate JSON files for each supported language
4. THE I18n_System SHALL validate JSON structure and syntax after modifications
5. THE I18n_System SHALL backup existing translation files before making changes

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to integrate with the existing Nuxt i18n module, so that the translation system works seamlessly with the current application architecture.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE I18n_System SHALL utilize the existing @nuxtjs/i18n module configuration
2. THE I18n_System SHALL respect current locale settings and fallback mechanisms
3. THE I18n_System SHALL maintain compatibility with existing i18n features
4. THE I18n_System SHALL support hot-reloading of translation files during development
5. WHERE configuration conflicts exist, THE I18n_System SHALL provide clear resolution guidance

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to validate the translation integration, so that I can ensure all text is properly internationalized and the application functions correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN integration is complete, THE I18n_System SHALL provide a validation report
2. THE I18n_System SHALL verify all Persian/Arabic strings have been replaced with i18n calls
3. THE I18n_System SHALL check that all translation keys exist in the translation files
4. THE I18n_System SHALL identify any missing or orphaned translation keys
5. THE I18n_System SHALL validate that the application renders correctly in all supported languages

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the CLI tool to work correctly out of the box, so that I can use the i18n integration features without encountering setup or execution errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the CLI tool is executed, THE I18n_System SHALL display proper help documentation and command options
2. THE I18n_System SHALL include all required dependencies in the package.json file
3. THE I18n_System SHALL have correct file paths configured for the binary and start scripts
4. THE I18n_System SHALL load configuration files properly and handle missing configuration gracefully
5. THE I18n_System SHALL provide clear error messages when commands fail or configuration is invalid
